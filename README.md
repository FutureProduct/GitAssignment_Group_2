  - Warnings are sent as the due date draws closer
- Social Media Aspect
  - See who is reading and what
  - Rental history is recorded
  - Social Credit Score is visible
- Library Social Credit Score [DYSTOPIAN TWIST]
  - The purpose of this is to introduce a limit to what kind of books someone can borrow
