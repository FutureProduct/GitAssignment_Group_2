Work in the same groups as the project.

Create a GitHub repo for the group.
Make the repo public or add all members of the group and my account (rfiske6) to the repo.

Each student should add a file with their name in the file name and some text in the file.

Add a file to the repo called group.java, this file should contain one method for each group member that returns their name (each member should write the method that returns their name).

Add a method called getGroupMembers that returns the names of all group members, each member should add their own names to the method.

Add three more methods:
int divide(int num1, int num2) calculates integer division num1/num2, should throw an Arithmetic exception if num2 is 0, or the result of num1/num2 is not a whole number.
int multiply(int num1, num2) calculates num1*num2
int power(int num1, num2); calculates num1 to the power of num2

You may not use the multiply or divide operators, or methods that calculate the results for you (use loops to do the calculation)



Add unit tests to verify all methods work correctly

Add a jenkins file to the project to allow the use of jenkins for the project.  You do not need to turn in any documentation showing jenkins working, but I do suggest verifying that it works before turning the assignment in.

What to turn in:
The git url for the repo and all member user names (along with your real name so I know which account belongs to which student)
